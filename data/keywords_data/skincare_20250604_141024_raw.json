I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"

        "text": "Isabella‚Äôs gaze met Grayson; the tension was palpable as her audacious proposal hung between them.\n\n‚ÄúYou heard me right, Mr. Grayson Blake. I‚Äôm offering to be your wife,‚Äù she reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you get in return?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with curiosity after a brief pause.\n\n‚ÄúI-I want out of the entertainment industry that‚Äôs been holding me captive; I need two hundred million.‚Äù\n\nIn two swift strides, Grayson closed the gap between them. Isabella found herself backing up until cool plaster met her shoulder blades. His proximity was overwhelming, his scent intoxicating. She swallowed hard, feeling herself melt under the intensity of his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBut a wife is expected to fulfill all her duties,‚Äù he murmured, his lips curving into a wolfish grin, ‚ÄúIncluding intimacy.‚Äù A cold shiver ran down Isabella‚Äôs spine as the words sank in.\n\n***\n\nIsabella\n\nI just finished my scene for ‚ÄúWhispers of the Heart,‚Äù a romance drama series where I have a small but important role. The show will premiere on major streaming platforms next season and is getting much attention.\n\nNot far from where I‚Äôm standing, I spot Gabriel Sterling, the lead actor, sharing a hearty laugh with Sabrina Morrison. People have been discussing a possible real-life romance between them for the past two years because of their on-screen chemistry.\n\nThe public has adored them since a live interview two years ago when Sabrina blushed the moment she first saw Gabriel. And, humbly, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt embarrass her.\n\nThat‚Äôs right! Gabriel became my fianc√© two years ago when he proposed to me‚Äîright around the time he signed a contract to show affection with Sabrina publicly.\n\nI should be used to seeing their on-screen sweetness by now‚Äîthe stolen glances and tender touches‚Äîbut every scene still stings, a sharp reminder of the cost of fame and the secrets we carry.\n\nMy talent manager, Sophia, a petite woman, approached me. ‚ÄúYour scenes are wrapped for today. The crew also mentioned you‚Äôre free to head home now.‚Äù\n\nSophia escorted me to my vehicle. She efficiently arranged my belongings in the back, ensuring everything was in order.\n\nAs I settled into the plush leather of the front passenger seat, Sophia hesitated.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, taking a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúUh, I heard there will be multiple bed scenes for the main cast in this series. They‚Äôre scheduled to start filming next week.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, raising my voice in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I informed about this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this series is a mature romance, not meant for young audiences,‚Äù Sophia says gently but firmly. ‚ÄúThere will be intimate scenes in some episodes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut Gabriel didn‚Äôt mention any of this to me,‚Äù I replied.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn‚Äôt want you to think poorly of him or worry unnecessarily.‚Äù\n\nThat is the case as always‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one who constantly worries.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel has never accepted bed scenes in the past,‚Äù I muse, almost to myself. ‚ÄúWhy would he agree to them now?‚Äù\n\nSophia stayed quiet, knowing when to give me space. She started the engine, and the car filled with a low hum. She could tell I was exhausted from being on set for 48 grueling hours, waiting for my scenes to wrap up. The long days and nights had turned into a blur of bright lights and repeated takes.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to find a moment of peace. But even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I can‚Äôt escape the dull ache in my chest.\n\nSophia said goodbye after dropping me off at the fancy skyscraper building where Gabriel and I lived. He proposed to me two years ago, and I agreed to move in with him instead of renting a separate place.\n\nFalling asleep, I only woke up when darkness had settled in, startled by rustling sounds in the room. Gabriel‚Äôs green eyes greeted me. He was standing at the door, looking bothered.\n\nHis usual sweetness was long gone. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he cleared his throat.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I heard you‚Äôll be having bed scenes with Sabrina,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Not wanting to sound like I was interrogating him, my voice shook a bit, especially since this was something he should have told me himself.\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He approached me and acted like everything was normal, and that I had nothing to worry about. I instinctively pulled away when he tried to kiss me on the cheek. Gabriel frowned, his brow furrowing deeply.\n\n‚ÄúIsa, this is a romance series! Besides, didn‚Äôt you already know about this since you also signed the contract as part of the cast?‚Äù\n\nThe heat rose to my temples. ‚ÄúGabriel, I have a small role! I was there when the director and writer explained the overall plot of this series, but not the specific scenes, especially since I‚Äôm not one of the main actors! You should have told me about it before accepting this role!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, I‚Äôm tired!‚Äù he murmured, exhaustion clear on his face. ‚ÄúCome on, I don‚Äôt want to argue. The intimate scenes are part of the role. I‚Äôm the lead and must accept whatever scenes they give me.‚Äù\n\nLooking at him, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It wasn‚Äôt just physical tiredness but an emotional weariness that seemed to seep into my bones. I never felt that he truly valued my feelings or considered how his actions affected me.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, let‚Äôs break up.‚Äù\n\nGabriel‚Äôs frown deepened.\n\n‚ÄúStop being ridiculous. Are you breaking up with me just because I agreed to the intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù he asked, his voice tinged with exasperation.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been comfortable with his relationship with Sabrina for a long time, and to be honest, she constantly nitpicks me when Gabriel isn‚Äôt around, her snide comments barely disguised as friendly banter. Since Sabrina is the main cast of this series, the crew is always on her side.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, come on. Don‚Äôt be too petty,‚Äù Gabriel pleaded, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm doing this for the fans. They‚Äôve been supporting me for years, and they wanted to see me step out of my usual conservative roles. Besides, Leo told me that this project could help me get internationally recognized. This is just a scene. I won‚Äôt do anything that will harm our relationship.‚Äù\n\nThe thing is, his actions have already damaged our relationship beyond repair.\n\nGabriel reached out, his warm fingers intertwining with mine as he lifted my hand to his lips. I searched my feelings, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore.\n\nI often gave in during situations like this, plastering on a smile and forcing myself to understand his perspective. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm tired, the weight of constant compromise bearing down on me.\n\nLooking into his stormy green eyes, I insisted, ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm serious. I want to break up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsa, don‚Äôt be unreasonable. I know you‚Äôre still angry...‚Äù he tried to console me. ‚ÄúWe have a planned trip to Aspen, Colorado next weekend, right? The crisp mountain air, just the two of us...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, next weekend is our supposed wedding,‚Äù I reminded him, my tone flat. His face remained calm, not a flicker of recognition passing across his features.\n\nSophia told me that Gabriel‚Äôs intimate scenes with Sabrina are scheduled for next week.\n\nHe paused for a moment but then smiled. ‚ÄúI know, baby. Leo has already booked the officiant for the wedding at the resort. It‚Äôll just be the two of us for our ceremony. I‚Äôm excited to marry you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve postponed the wedding twice already. I hope it finally happens this time,‚Äù I said bitterly.\n\nI could see the guilt flash across his face.\n\nHe was often called by the management of Golden Stage Entertainment‚Äîthe agency that handles both of us. The first time Gabriel canceled the wedding, Leo, his talent manager, informed him that the management suddenly called him to explain the new project. The second time, Sabrina had a scandal, and the management wanted Gabriel to speak on her behalf, using his reputation to calm the media frenzy.\n\nI wonder now what excuse he might have this time. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm already anticipating our trip to the secluded resort won‚Äôt push through again, the disappointment, a familiar ache in my chest.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of waiting, loving him, and being second best in his career.\n\nGabriel forced a smile and kissed my hand again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll finally get married this time, babe. I promise.‚Äù\n\nNo longer wanting to argue with Gabriel, all that‚Äôs left is to wait for the day, preparing my heart for the inevitable disappointment.\n\n***\n\nSophia and I met for a photo shoot because I had taken on a small brand to promote their skincare products. This was also the day to capture some intimate scenes between Gabriel and Sabrina for the romance series, a fact that felt heavy in my stomach.\n\nSophia approached me after the photoshoot. She handed me a chilled bottle of water and wrapped me in a plush white robe because I was only wearing a thin tube top to showcase the smoothness of my skin in the photos.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm more scared of what you‚Äôre doing right now than any of these promo shots,‚Äù Sophia said, her brow furrowed with concern as we headed to the dressing room to change. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay with Gabriel and Sabrina‚Äôs setup on set?‚Äù\n\nI took a sip of water, savoring the cool liquid.\n\n‚ÄúI tried to break up with Gabriel last week when I found out about the scenes,‚Äù I said casually as if discussing the weather.\n\nHer eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou did? And he agreed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSophia, do I look stupid?‚Äù I asked instead. There was a hint of sadness in my voice. ‚ÄúGabriel seemed to see a pattern with me. He‚Äôd make a mistake in our relationship. He‚Äôd coax me, and I would eventually forgive whatever we argued about because I couldn‚Äôt stand not giving in to him. But I feel like it‚Äôs becoming a routine, a dance I‚Äôm tired of performing.‚Äù\n\nSophia scratched the side of her head. She doesn‚Äôt like Gabriel for me because I can‚Äôt stand up for myself with my boyfriend. In truth, she was shocked when she found out that I was in a relationship with a famous actor.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean you two reconciled, and he persuaded you to do his intimate scenes with Sabrina?‚Äù\n\nWe entered the dressing room, the door clicking shut behind us and giving us a private space where no one could hear us.\n\n‚ÄúHe already decided and signed a contract. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do about it,‚Äù I replied.\n\nAfter changing into my casual clothes, Sophia informed me while reading a message on her phone.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just one scene set to be filmed today,‚Äù she informed me.\n\nI checked my watch. Gabriel needed to finish his scene because we had a flight to Colorado tomorrow. Our long-awaited wedding weekend was just around the corner, a bittersweet promise.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the film set,‚Äù I suggested to Sophia.\n\nEven though Sophia was hesitant to take me to the scene because of her concerns, her eyes clouded with worry, she still accompanied me to a luxurious hotel.\n\nIn the director‚Äôs large monitor, I was in the background, a silent spectator watching the two people passionately kissing. Gabriel‚Äôs lips grazed over Sabrina‚Äôs neck, his fingers tangled in her hair. Sabrina also gave her all, her body arching into his touch. The director was delighted to see the chemistry between the two main cast members in bed for their scene.\n\nHere I was, torturing myself even more. My chest tightened at the scene, a vice grip around my heart, but I had to accept this because I had a boyfriend who was an actor. I wanted to wake myself up, to shake off this surreal nightmare.\n\nSophia suggested we leave after seeing the pain in my eyes.\n\nI love Gabriel so much; I‚Äôm always happy with his career growth. I have always accepted that he‚Äôs not just my fianc√© but a public figure. He‚Äôs a dedicated actor, and his passion for his craft is evident in every scene. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, I want to know and think about what my position is in Gabriel‚Äôs heart.\n\nAm I just another supporting character in his blockbuster life?\n\nWhen Sophia and I stepped outside, the cool air was refreshing from the stuffy set. I was surprised to see Charlotte Prescott and Lucas Murphy in the hotel lobby.\n\nThe two people who pulled me into my situation‚Ä¶\n\nThe corners of my cousin Charlotte‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. She stood beside Lucas Murphy, my childhood friend, their hands intertwined. Lucas, now a distinguished board member at Golden Stage Entertainment, was engaged to Charlotte, my cousin, who also happened to be the head talent manager at his company.\n\nBecause of her position, Charlotte controlled both my and Gabriel‚Äôs careers, which is why I never got any major roles despite years of hard work and many auditions. Her influence was everywhere in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas frowned at me, his forehead creasing with disapproval. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nCharlotte, trying to maintain her pleasant demeanor for Lucas, chimed in, her voice dripping with false sweetness, ‚ÄúPerhaps she found out we were visiting the set and decided to stir up trouble... Isabella, how many times do I have to tell you? If only you were better at acting, you‚Äôd be in Sabrina‚Äôs position by now.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt entirely blame them for thinking that way.\n\nTwo years ago, because of Lucas‚Äô influence and as a friend, I turned to him when I wanted to end the public rumors about my boyfriend and Sabrina‚Äôs relationship. He had agreed to help me. But Charlotte intervened just three days later. She accused me of using Gabriel to get Lucas‚Äôs attention, making me look like a desperate and scheming woman.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Lucas started seeing me as nothing more than a delusional childhood friend. We used to be close, always supporting one another, but everything changed the moment Charlotte came into our lives. She captivated Lucas's attention, wrapping him around her perfectly manicured finger.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, Isabella,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice softening for Lucas‚Äôs sake, ‚ÄúUncle Fred has been asking about you. Stop being stubborn and go back to the mansion. Your family misses you.‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore when she mentioned my father.\n\n‚ÄúYou know what, Charlotte? You should have been an actress instead of a talent manager. You‚Äôre such a natural at pretending,‚Äù I snapped, my teeth clenched in irritation, hands balled into fists at my sides.\n\n‚ÄúLook at yourself!‚Äù Lucas fired back, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs been nothing but concerned for you. She‚Äôs taken on the responsibility of caring for your parents, and this is how you repay her?‚Äù\n\nI scoffed bitterly, feeling the familiar ache of betrayal in my chest. ‚ÄúIs that what she told you? That I abandoned my parents?‚Äù\n\nThe truth hurt deeply‚Äîmy parents broke my heart when they believed Charlotte‚Äôs lies over me when I was just sixteen. They abandoned me, falling for one lie after another, and left me to struggle in a world that seemed set on making me fail.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella, I know the truth. You‚Äôve always been jealous of Charlotte, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre acting like this!‚Äù\n\nI stared at him, feeling the weight of his betrayal settle heavily on my shoulders. Lucas was supposed to be my friend, but he‚Äôd already let me down. Explaining myself was pointless. In his eyes, I would always be the villain of this story.\n\nI walked past them without saying a word, keeping my head high and pretending they weren‚Äôt there. It was then that I remembered Sophia was with me, her surprised expression showing how shocked she was by my ease around the couple. Her eyes moved back and forth between me and them as we left.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs perfectly painted lips curved into a triumphant smile. She was clearly pleased that Lucas was growing more agitated by the second, his face flushing a deeper shade of red.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù Lucas shouted, his voice bouncing off the hallway walls, but I kept walking, leaving them behind.\n\n‚ÄúLove, just let her go,‚Äù I heard Charlotte say in her sweet, manipulative tone. ‚ÄúShe always pulls this for attention. She‚Äôll come around once she realizes we‚Äôre just trying to do what‚Äôs best for her.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as Sophia and I settled into the car, her curiosity bubbled over, and she couldn‚Äôt help but speak up.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Boss Lucas Murphy and Charlotte Prescott?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt they help me with my acting career?‚Äù I finished for her. ‚ÄúYou saw how they treated me back there. Lucas maybe my childhood friend, but when it comes to Charlotte, he‚Äôs blind to everything.‚Äù\n\nSophia nodded, her expression thoughtful. She knew well enough that Lucas and Charlotte were the power couple of the company, their influence reaching every corner of the industry. Lucas adored Charlotte so much that nothing else seemed to matter.\n\nRealization dawned on Sophia‚Äôs face as she connected the dots. ‚ÄúCharlotte is your cousin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged my shoulder and leaned back in the chair, trying to appear nonchalant.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, how? I‚Äôve been handling your career for the past three years, and they often reject some of the jobs assigned to you. They always changed them last minute.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause Charlotte wanted my life,‚Äù I simply said. I‚Äôve known about it for a long time, but eventually, I just gave up, feeling all my energy slip away.\n\n‚ÄúCharlotte entered my family‚Äôs mansion when we were ten‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to tell the story.\n\nI consider Sophia a friend, and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about my life to the public. Her loyalty was one of my few comforts in this cutthroat industry.\n\n‚ÄúHer parents died in a car accident, and my parents took her in. She came from a modest family and became interested in my family‚Äôs life. At first, she took Lucas‚Äô attention away from me when we were teenagers. Lucas is from a wealthy family. She used her pitiful life to win Lucas‚Äô affection‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI paused for a moment, searching my feelings to see if I still felt any pain, but it had turned to ice because of my experience.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was sixteen, Charlotte made a bold move to make my parents hate me completely. She planted weed in my closet‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, the memory still sharp despite the years that had passed.\n\nSophia‚Äôs eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.\n\nThe look in my parents‚Äô eyes is still vivid from that day.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom was devastated; she couldn‚Äôt believe what they found in my things. Without a second thought, my dad slapped me. He accused me of being rebellious, saying I was too young to be so disobedient. That moment marked the beginning of the rift between me and my parents. Charlotte was always one step ahead, and though I tried to be good despite everything, I resented them deeply. I didn‚Äôt try to appease them or prove I was the good child they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI smiled bitterly, the taste of those memories still sour on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhen I was 18, Charlotte took things even further to ruin me. I caught her slipping a pregnancy test kit into my belongings. When I confronted my mom, she believed Charlotte over me. Furious, she dragged me to the hospital, where it was confirmed I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She never apologized, and the damage had already been done.‚Äù\n\nMy mom is a well-known fashion designer. Her reputation meant everything to her, seemingly more than her own daughter. I never shared this with Sophia; the shame and pain felt too raw to reveal.\n\nI continued, ‚ÄúThat was when I decided to leave home because the hurt ran too deep. I enrolled in an art school and eventually chose to study design at an Art University abroad. That‚Äôs where I met Gabriel.‚Äù\n\nAt the university, Gabriel was the most handsome man I had ever seen, and he was the one who helped me in one incident. Gabriel quickly captured my young heart, still fragile from years of family turmoil. I didn‚Äôt think twice about switching to an acting course just to be close to him, abandoning my passion for design.\n\nBut was that just my role in Gabriel‚Äôs life‚Äîto wait on the sidelines, longing for even a small taste of his affection, like a piece of candy just out of reach?\n\nThe more I shared my story, the heavier the sadness in my chest grew.\n\n‚ÄúAnyway, let‚Äôs not dwell on them,‚Äù Sophia said, igniting the engine car to take me to the apartment I had asked her to find the other day.\n\nGabriel hadn‚Äôt called me in two days. During this time, I‚Äôd already begun moving into the new place I‚Äôd found because, deep down, I knew he‚Äôd let me down again. The silence of his absence spoke volumes.\n\nWhen Sophia dropped me off at the apartment, she hesitated, scratching her temple. Her eyes darted around the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not returning to the place you shared with Gabriel? I‚Äôm worried about you being here alone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone there too, Sophia,‚Äù I replied, my voice edged with sadness. ‚ÄúI might as well be on my own. I‚Äôve been here for two days, and Gabriel hasn‚Äôt even bothered to call. He‚Äôs staying at the hotel.‚Äù\n\nGabriel had grown comfortable with the idea of me waiting around, like a cat always there when he decided to come home.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, you‚Äôre free for a week,‚Äù Sophia said, her tone professional but tinged with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once I‚Äôve secured a new project for you and update you on the final scenes for this series. Just take a break for now.‚Äù\n\nShe thought I was simply on vacation, unaware of the plans Gabriel and I had made to get married.\n\nI forced a smile and replied, ‚ÄúTake care!‚Äù\n\nAfter ensuring I was okay on my own, Sophia left.\n\nLater, as I soaked in the bathtub, I scrolled through my social media feed. Suddenly, I stumbled upon Gabriel‚Äôs post, and my heart lurched painfully in my chest.\n\nThe caption read, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with you.‚Äô\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have minded a simple post like that, but the candid photo of him and Sabrina was mocking me. He was smiling radiantly, gazing into her eyes as if they were utterly in love as if I had never existed.\n\nThere were many comments wishing they would admit their relationship.\n\nI stopped paying attention to my feelings and submerged myself in the water, letting the muffled silence envelop me.\n\nBy morning, the names Gabriel and Sabrina were trending on social media platforms. Someone saw them enter a hotel suite together.\n\nUncertainty loomed over whether this was still for their publicity, but I no longer want to tire myself thinking about it. I packed my small luggage and went to the airport to visit Mexico.\n\nI arrived at Benito Ju√°rez International Airport in Mexico City in the afternoon. As soon as I opened my cellphone, it rang, and Gabriel‚Äôs name appeared on the screen.\n\nI decided to answer. ‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDamn it, Isa! You finally answered. L-listen, I‚Ä¶‚Äù After panicking, he didn‚Äôt know what to say next, heaving a heavy sigh.\n\nWhat happened? The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.\n\n‚ÄúBaby, I‚Ä¶ I was drunk. I got back to the apartment late‚Ä¶ Are you in Colorado now? Wait for me there, alright? I rebooked my flight so I can be with you soon‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶\" His words tumbled out, desperate and pleading.\n\nSomething felt off; the tremble in his voice was unmistakable.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, you don‚Äôt need to leave anymore. You don‚Äôt need to explain either.‚Äù I paused, steeling myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious; it‚Äôs over between us.‚Äù\n\nAfter hanging up my call with Gabriel, my phone kept buzzing with messages from him and my talent manager, Sophia.\n\nSophia: Isabella, are you alright? Gabriel‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, trying to locate you. You won‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîA photo of him entering the Lotus Suite at the Grand Plaza Hotel with Sabrina went viral this morning. They didn‚Äôt come out until after noon! Management got the photos taken down after a few hours, but the damage was done. Chatter is buzzing with rumors.\n\nChatter is a social media platform known for spreading celebrity rumors.\n\nNow it made sense why Gabriel sounded so restless on the phone.\n\nHe had cheated‚Äîwith Sabrina!\n\nDespite promises to me just last week, Gabriel knew precisely what he was doing. After five long years of waiting and believing in us, my heart finally gave up.\n\nI pulled my suitcase and headed to the secluded resort in Mexico where I planned to stay for a few days. Gabriel kept calling, but I ignored him. Frustrated by his persistence, I eventually blocked his number.\n\nMy mind was made up‚ÄîI would spend the next few days walking on the beach, breathing in the salty air, and finally shutting down my feelings for Gabriel for good.\n\n***\n\nA week later, I returned to Century City, Los Angeles. Sophia handed me my final schedule for a few scenes in the series.\n\nAfter wrapping up the scene, I expressed my gratitude to the director and some crew members for their care. Due to my minor role, I knew they hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to me on set.\n\nAs I headed towards my dressing room, an unexpected face was waiting for me at the door: Gabriel. His handsomeness was as striking as ever, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the worry lines on his forehead showed real guilt or mere inconvenience.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk,‚Äù he said, his voice steady.\n\nGlancing around, some staff members were watching us with confusion, likely wondering why Gabriel, who had barely acknowledged me on set, was now seeking me out.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need something from me, Mr. Sterling?‚Äù I asked casually.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, my name lingering in the air like a plea.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, if you‚Äôre worried about your image, this isn‚Äôt the best place to talk,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou know that, right?‚Äù I gestured subtly to the onlookers.\n\nHe frowned, clearly aware of the truth in my words. His shoulders tensed as he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúBut please, return to the apartment.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of speaking with Gabriel in person crossed my mind. Causing a scene in front of the curious onlookers wouldn‚Äôt be ideal, and a few things needed to be collected from his apartment.\n\nWith a sigh, I agreed, ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù\n\nHis face brightened, his green eyes sparkling as if he believed I had given in again. It was a familiar pattern‚Äîjust a little effort from him, and I would back down.\n\nThat night, I made my way to our apartment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease wait for me here,‚Äù I told Sophia.\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked, concern lacing her voice.\n\nI forced a smile, hoping it looked more convincing than it felt. ‚ÄúYes, babe. I‚Äôll grab my things and personally end my relationship with Gabriel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat jerk! He hooked up with Sabrina after those intimate scenes! I really hate him!‚Äù\n\nI understood why Sophia was so angry. Gabriel always put his management duties first, even above our relationship. It drove her crazy that, after five years in a relationship, including the two years as his fiancee, he never stood up for me against the management‚Äôs disrespect. Gabriel had a name in the industry and influence that could have protected me. So why did he let them belittle me all the time?\n\nI took the sleek elevator to his apartment and entered the code that had been etched in my memory from the two years I lived there.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was taken aback to find Gabriel standing just a meter inside. He was dressed casually in a faded blue T-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nI instinctively closed the door behind me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. I cooked dinner; let‚Äôs eat together,‚Äù he said in a warm voice.\n\nThe aroma of spices wafted from the kitchen, enticing yet bittersweet.\n\nSteeling myself, I kept my voice level as I replied, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be eating, Gabriel. I‚Äôm just here to collect my things. Sophia is waiting for me downstairs.‚Äù\n\nWithout waiting for his response, I walked straight to the bedroom, pulled out the pink suitcase from the wardrobe, and began packing my belongings one by one.\n\nGabriel leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a furrowed brow betraying his frustration. ‚ÄúIsabella... when are you going to stop this tantrum?‚Äù\n\nHis words hurt, reminding me why I was leaving. He saw my feelings as mere tantrums.\n\nI met his gaze, steadying myself. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm not just sulking. I‚Äôve already told you‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree!‚Äù he shouted, his voice rising with frustration.\n\nI sighed, exhaustion settling in like a heavy fog. ‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm drained by this relationship.‚Äù\n\nHe hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. ‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm only doing those things with Sabrina for publicity, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you cheated, it stopped being about publicity.‚Äù To my surprise, I remained calm. Usually, these conversations ended in tears, with his anger spilling over as he stormed out, leaving me alone in the dimly lit apartment.\n\nHis lips trembled, a wave of emotion threatening to spill over. ‚ÄúI messed up, Isabella! I know I did. Please‚Ä¶ can you give me another chance?‚Äù\n\nChance? The request felt almost absurd, a bitter joke.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, how many chances have I already given you?‚Äù I pressed, searching his face for answers.\n\nHis mouth fell open, then snapped shut as he swallowed hard, a storm of regret brewing in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even count them anymore, can you?‚Äù I finished, closing my luggage with a heavy heart.\n\nHe noticed I had packed only a few things‚Äîjust the essentials and some casual clothes.\n\nI moved toward the door, pulling my suitcase.\n\nBefore I could turn the knob, Gabriel clenched his teeth. ‚ÄúIsabella, once you walk out that door, there‚Äôs no turning back!‚Äù\n\nI turned to face him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúGabriel, the moment you decided to have intimate scenes with Sabrina without telling me, I made my decision to end things. If I truly mattered to you, you would have been honest instead of leaving me uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhenever you post about you and Sabrina, you should understand how I feel as your real girlfriend. Please don‚Äôt contact me anymore. I won‚Äôt say anything publicly about our relationship‚Äîthat‚Äôs my parting gift.‚Äù\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting off our tense conversation. I figured it might be Sophia waiting for me.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Sabrina and I were caught off guard, the air thick with surprise and unspoken feelings.\n\nSeeing Sabrina outside our apartment‚Äôs door was bitterly ironic. On one hand, I would no longer live here. Gabriel could welcome anyone he wanted‚Äîjust like he already had.\n\n‚ÄúTh-this...‚Äù Gabriel stammered, his voice catching in his throat, clearly blindsided.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd be here, Isabella. I came to talk to Gabriel about last week,‚Äù Sabrina murmured, playing the part of the victim.\n\nI pressed my lips together, my gaze shifting to Gabriel. Panic flickered in his eyes, a silent plea. But at that moment, my heart turned cold.\n\n‚ÄúSabrina, the security here is tight. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the apartment floor without clearance,‚Äù I remarked casually, though my pulse quickened.\n\nSabrina reached into her designer handbag and held up a familiar keycard. ‚ÄúI used this. It‚Äôs my third time.‚Äù\n\nThe third time? I stayed silent, but the question seared through my thoughts. Where was I during these clandestine visits? Out working late, trusting, and oblivious?\n\nGabriel‚Äôs voice wavered with desperation. ‚ÄúIsabella, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. The first time, she just needed to change clothes. Last week... I was drunk. I hadn‚Äôt gotten the keycard back yet, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù I cut him off, turning away.\n\nI stepped into the elevator and swiped the keycard over the sensor before handing it back to Gabriel as he rushed over.\n\n‚ÄúGabriel, I‚Äôm giving this back.‚Äù I placed the card in his trembling hand. ‚ÄúSophia already took care of the apartment bills. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else left to settle.‚Äù My voice stayed calm.\n\nHis hand shook as he grasped the card, stunned by my icy detachment. ‚ÄúIsabella, please...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to Sabrina and figure out your relationship,‚Äù I said calmly.\n\n\"We don‚Äôt have a relationship!\" His voice escalated, filled with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been so understanding about my career. How can you do this over a mere rumor?‚Äù\n\nI had so much to say, but it felt pointless now‚Äîdisappointment had turned me into a shell, indifferent to everything.\n\nSabrina pulled his arms. \"Gabriel, just let her go. I came here to talk, and I have no ill intentions toward your relationship. If Isabella can‚Äôt see my purpose, then she doesn‚Äôt truly love you.\"\n\nHer words seemed to lift Gabriel, bringing out a dark side in him. \"Mark my words, Isabella. If you leave now, don‚Äôt you dare think of coming back!\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, sealing him behind as my heart hardened once more.\n\nFor five years, I followed Gabriel like a shadow, my own identity slowly fading into the background. I relentlessly chased his dreams, supporting him in every conceivable way. Along the way, I lost sight of my own dreams, foolishly believing that Gabriel was the only one that mattered.\n\nBut now, I see clearly. He‚Äôs not worth my tears, let alone the years I‚Äôve wasted.\n\nIn the elevator, descending from the apartment that was once called my sanctuary, my phone rang. I expected it to be Gabriel, so my heart skipped a beat. Instead, I was surprised to see my father‚Äôs name on the screen‚Äîa rare sight that made me curious and uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered after a hesitant swipe.\n\n‚ÄúCome home. We need to talk,‚Äù my father said, his voice stern.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just talk on the phone?‚Äù I asked, hoping to avoid the confrontation. The idea of facing my parents after years of hardly speaking was overwhelming.\n\n‚ÄúIsabella!‚Äù he snapped, ‚ÄúI raised you, took care of you, and gave you everything‚Äîeven though you‚Äôve been away for years! Is this how you thank your parents?‚Äù\n\nThe last time a real conversation happened between us was a blur in my memory.\n\n‚ÄúCome home to the mansion,‚Äù he added sharply, leaving no room for debate. ‚ÄúYour mother and I have something important to tell you.‚Äù\n\nTo end the tense exchange, I agreed. I hung up the call, feeling unsettled.\n\nWhen the elevator doors opened, I was surprised to see Sophia there, her usual calm expression replaced by worry.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked, concern etched on her face. ‚ÄúI saw Sabrina get out of her car... I know she went to Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôve been worried sick about you.‚Äù\n\nI forced a smile. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm going to lash out at Sabrina just because she slept with my boyfriend?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot really... I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre okay. This whole situation is so messed up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForget about them,‚Äù I said, waving my hand dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm free now‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù\n\nBut I never thought this newfound freedom would take me right into the trouble waiting for me at home.\n\n***\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, disbelief flooding my voice as my father‚Äôs words hung like a toxic cloud. I clenched my jaw, disappointment coursing through me.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Isabella... I have to do this to repay your parents for taking me in. But I‚Äôm already involved with Lucas.‚Äù As usual, my cousin Charlotte acted like a fragile flower, hiding her true nature behind a mask of vulnerability.\n\nOf course, my father felt better about her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak like that, Charlotte. You did better than this wench!‚Äù\n\nMom reached out to hold my hand. ‚ÄúIsabella,‚Äù she pleaded, ‚Äúyour dad needs this project to support the company. It‚Äôs worth millions. Mr. Shaw has one request to continue this crucial contract: they want you to marry their son.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI already met that jerk, Mom!‚Äù I spat, unable to hide my disgust. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a substance misuser and treats women horribly! You want me to marry someone you know won‚Äôt respect me?‚Äù The resentment in my voice was apparent, years of frustration boiling over.\n\nMy mother couldn‚Äôt meet my gaze, guilt etching deep lines on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you so proud of?‚Äù Dad sneered, ‚ÄúThat boyfriend you‚Äôre clinging to doesn‚Äôt respect you either! He‚Äôs involved with someone else! Break up with Gabriel Sterling and do as we say if you want a place in this family!‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs anger lashed out like a whip.\n\nCharlotte‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, her eyes glittering with malice. ‚ÄúOh, Uncle, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù she chimed in, her voice sickeningly sweet. ‚ÄúI heard from Gabriel‚Äôs assistant that they already broke up!‚Äù\n\nI burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to lash out at the witch who had poisoned my relationship with my parents. But holding back was necessary, knowing it would only give them more reason to criticize me.\n\n‚ÄúGood! If you don‚Äôt marry the Shaws, we‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre our daughter!‚Äù my father threatened. My mother‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, but all I felt was a tightening knot of disappointment in my chest, a familiar ache growing for years.\n\nFilled with determination and heartbreak, I declared, ‚ÄúThen go ahead, sever your ties with me!\n\nThe silence followed was overwhelming, shattered only by the sharp sound of a slap. A heavy hand struck my cheek.\n\nüëáüëáüëá \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)"
